# OnTheMap

## About

On The Map is the 3rd student project in the Udacity iOS Nanodegree course. In this project, students focused on learning the foundation of Networking with iOS frameworks. In addition, this project required students to use aspects from previous parts of the iOS course to build a fully functioning app that allows Udacity students to drop a "pin" on a map along with a link to a media site of their choosing and then share with other Udacity Students.
